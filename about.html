        <p>While in college I decided I needed to get more involved with what is relevant in my life and that if I was ever going to be serious about a career change in my life I would need to act promptly.</p>

        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I could'nt believe a place like this existed but again I was surprised to find and never looked back since.</a>

        <p>If there ever is a need or trend for oppertunity to hire new developers, I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
        
        <p>Outside from learning software development, I like to participate in social activities, and hang out with friends.
           </p>
         
         <p> Sometimes, I like to just go to the library and pick out novels to read to help me visualize my life in fantasy places. </p>
